# GL training group project. 
Python based web app, which presents the actual and historical prices of selected cryptocurrencies in the particular currency. 
Data should be fetched from chosen open API and presented in form of charts and tables. 
Fetched data and prices trends should be analysed, so app suggests when to buy or sell particular cryptocurrencies. 

Technologies considered to be used: Flask, yfinance, Pandas, plotly

Following decisions were made during the brainstorm phase of the project:

The API:
The API to be used is called 'CoinGecko'. This API was carefully chosen among the other cryptocurrency APIs, due to its easy understanding and implementation. Through research of the APIs that would help reach the goal of creating the python based project app, this one was decided to be the best choice. The API was tested, and it ran flawlessly. (Main factors that led to the decision: Ease of use, meets the requirements).

Technology used (framework):
Flask or Django? The framework of choice, after considering the requirements, needs and possibilities of the team is Flask. Django proved to be much harder to use, and understand hence Flask was chosen in it's place. Flask meets all the expectations just as much as Django does, so chosing Flask over Django due to its easier form isn't affecting the project in any way.
